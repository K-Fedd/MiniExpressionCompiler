# RecursiveCompiler
Recursive compiler is a java file designed to solve any math problem that
1. uses integers and the following operators +, -, /, *, (, )
2. doesnt include negative numbers
3. doesnt attempt to multiply without the * operator, no numbers directly outside of parentheses
4. follows all other typical rules associated with math problems (divide by zero, multiple operators in a row like ***, no numbers in the equation, etc)

To use the compiler, run the recursive compiler file, at which point you should be prompted to input an equation. If you follow the above rules, the equation should solve, the solution (in the form of an integer), my best attempt at a depth tree, and the equation's tokens should print.
